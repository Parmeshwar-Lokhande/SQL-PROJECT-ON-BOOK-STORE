Analyzed book store sales data using SQL to uncover customer behavior, sales trends, and revenue insights.

1) Overview :-

This project focuses on analyzing a book store’s transactional data using SQL.
The goal is to extract meaningful business insights such as top-selling books, customer purchase patterns, revenue contribution, and order trends.
The project demonstrates strong SQL fundamentals including joins, aggregations, subqueries, and filtering techniques commonly used by data analysts.

2) Problem Statement:-

The book store wants to understand:

Which books and categories generate the most revenue

Customer purchasing behavior

Sales performance across different orders

Opportunities to improve sales and customer engagement

The challenge is to transform raw relational data into actionable insights using SQL.


3) Dataset:-

The project uses three CSV datasets:

1) Books.csv

Book ID

Title

Author

Genre

Price

2)Customers.csv

Customer ID

Customer Name

Email

Location

3) Orders.csv

Order ID

Customer ID

Book ID

Order Date

Quantity

Total Amount

4) Tools and Technologies:-

SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL compatible)

DBMS: MySQL / PostgreSQL

GitHub for version control

CSV files as data source

5) Method:-

Imported CSV files into SQL tables

Cleaned and validated data

Created relationships using primary and foreign keys

Used SQL queries involving:

JOIN

GROUP BY

ORDER BY

Subqueries

Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

Extracted business insights from query results

6) Key Insights:-

Identified top-selling books and genres

Found high-value customers based on purchase amount

Analyzed monthly and overall sales trends

Determined revenue contribution by book and customer

Discovered frequently purchased books

7) Dashboard / Model / Output:-

SQL query outputs displayed as result tables

Insights can be further visualized using Power BI / Tableau (optional)

Query file: SQL PROJECT ON BOOK STORE.sql

8) How to Run This Project:-
